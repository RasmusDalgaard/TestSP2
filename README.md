## Reflections

### 1.1 Computer Mouse  
Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure that it is of the higest quality.  

I would perform Unit Testing on each of the individual parts of the mouse (mouse1, mouse2, scroll wheel, sensor etc.) Then I would perform Tntegration Tests to make sure, that the individual parts of the mouse actually work together (movement of mouse while scrolling and clicking).  
Usability Testing could also be a great choice to ensure that the design works as intended and that the user can give feedback about improvements or things that just didn't work that well.
Acceptance Testing helps identifying if the business requirements are met and are essential in making sure that the product is capable of performing the required tasks and thereby maintaining the higest quality. 
Furthermore, Performance Testing could also help ensuring the higesht quality of mouse by testing its durability but also its performance during high workloads. 

### 1.2 Catastrophic Failure  
Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what happened. Can you find a test that would have prevented it?  

## Two Katas  
Complete the following using BDD.  

### String Unity  
Use BDD to create a string utility with the following methods:  
* Reverse string (aBc -> cBa)
* Capitalize string (aBC -> ABC)
* Lowercase string (aBc -> abc)

Don't use any built-in string utility – create your own. Remember, the exercise here is to
use BDD, not to deliver a working utility without tests. If there are no tests in the
solution, it won’t be accepted.  

### Bowling Game Kata  
Complete the Bowling Game Kata using BDD. The slides can be found here:

## Investigation Of Tools  

### JUnit 5  
Investigate JUnit 5 (Jupiter). Explain the following, and how they are useful.  
* @tag
* @Disabled
* @RepeatedTest
* @BeforeEach, @AfterEach
* @BeforeAll, @AfterAll
* @DisplayName
* @Nested
* assumeFalse, assumeTrue

### Mocking Frameworks  
Investigate mocking frameworks for your preferred language. Choose at least two
frameworks, and answer the questions. (One could be Mockito, which we saw in class.)  
* What are their similarities?
* What are their differences?
* Which one would you prefer, id any, and why?
