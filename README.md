# TestSP2

## Reflections

### 1.1 Computer Mouse  
Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure that it is of the higest quality.  


### 1.2 Catastrophic Failure  
Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what happened. Can you find a test that would have prevented it?  

## Two Katas  
Complete the following using BDD.  

### String Unity  
Use BDD to create a string utility with the following methods:  
* Reverse string (aBc -> cBa)
* Capitalize string (aBC -> ABC)
* Lowercase string (aBc -> abc)

Don't use any built-in string utility – create your own. Remember, the exercise here is to
use BDD, not to deliver a working utility without tests. If there are no tests in the
solution, it won’t be accepted.  

### Bowling Game Kata  
Complete the Bowling Game Kata using BDD. The slides can be found here:

## Investigation Of Tools  

### JUnit 5  
Investigate JUnit 5 (Jupiter). Explain the following, and how they are useful.  
* @tag
* @Disabled
* @RepeatedTest
* @BeforeEach, @AfterEach
* @BeforeAll, @AfterAll
* @DisplayName
* @Nested
* assumeFalse, assumeTrue

### Mocking Frameworks  
Investigate mocking frameworks for your preferred language. Choose at least two
frameworks, and answer the questions. (One could be Mockito, which we saw in class.)  
* What are their similarities?
* What are their differences?
* Which one would you prefer, id any, and why?
